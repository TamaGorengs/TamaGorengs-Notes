# 👨‍💻 Whoami

Hey there! I’m **Tamago**—cybersecurity enthusiast, penetration tester, and occasional breaker-of-things (all in the name of security, of course).

If you’re into poking around networks, finding sneaky vulnerabilities, and learning how to hack stuff _legally_ without getting your Wi-Fi disconnected by your ISP, you’re in the right place. This blog is where I share my adventures in cybersecurity, from tackling weird bugs to ranting about why firewalls sometimes act like they're on strike.

Whether you’re here to sharpen your hacking skills, laugh at my trial-and-error moments, or just see what pentesting is all about, I’ve got you covered. So grab a coffee (or your beverage of choice), and let’s explore the wild, weird, and wonderful world of cybersecurity together.

For my personal blog you guys can go to my **blogging page** at [**https://tamagorengs.com**](https://tamagorengs.com)

Stay curious, don’t click sketchy links,\
**Tamago**
